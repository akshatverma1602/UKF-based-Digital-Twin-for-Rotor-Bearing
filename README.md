# Digital Twin of a Rotor–Bearing System

A physics-based **digital twin** of a rotating shaft on instrumented bearings.
A model of the rotor runs alongside a simulated machine, and a recursive
Bayesian estimator continuously updates the model's **bearing stiffness and
damping** from noisy displacement measurements. As a seeded bearing fault
develops, the estimated coefficients diverge from their healthy nominal values —
and that divergence, together with the filter's innovation statistics, becomes a
physically interpretable condition indicator.

The point of the project is to **couple state estimation, physics-based
modelling, and condition monitoring**: the Kalman filter updates *actual
physical parameters of the rotor*, not abstract signal features.

## 1. Physical basis

The plant is a **2-DOF Jeffcott (Laval) rotor**: a disk of mass `m` on a
flexible massless shaft supported on bearings, with lateral displacements
`x` (horizontal) and `y` (vertical).

```
M q̈ + C q̇ + K q = f(t) ,      q = [x, y]ᵀ
M = diag(m, m)
K = [[kxx, kxy], [kyx, kyy]]      C = [[cxx, cxy], [cyx, cyy]]
```

Excitation is **rotating mass unbalance** plus gravity:

```
f(t) = m e Ω² [cos Ωt, sin Ωt]ᵀ + [0, −mg]ᵀ
```

In first-order state-space form with state `z = [x, ẋ, y, ẏ]ᵀ`:

```
ż = A(θ) z + b(t) ,      A(θ) = [[0, I], [−M⁻¹K, −M⁻¹C]]
```

Proximity probes measure the two displacements only: `y_k = H z_k + v_k`,
`H = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0]]`.

The default rotor sits at a **subcritical service speed** (Ω = 300 rad/s ≈
47.7 Hz; critical speeds 71.2 Hz / 78.0 Hz), the operating regime of most
production machinery.

## 2. Digital-twin concept

The twin holds the same physics model but treats the four bearing coefficients
as **unknown** and re-estimates them at every measurement step. Healthy →
estimates sit at nominal and the model predicts the data. Fault grows → reality
drifts from nominal, and the estimator tracks that drift **in the physical
parameters themselves**, which is what makes the output diagnosable rather than
merely anomalous.

```
 truth plant ──► measurements ──► joint UKF ──► innovation / NIS (anomaly)
 (degrading)      (probe+noise)    (twin)    └─► estimated k,c  ──► fault severity
                                   nominal model ─────────────────►   (vs nominal)
```

## 3. Estimator (the maths)

Because the bearing coefficients sit inside `A(θ)` and **multiply the state**,
joint state+parameter estimation is intrinsically **nonlinear** — a linear
Kalman filter cannot do it. The state is augmented with the (log) parameters:

```
ζ = [x, ẋ, y, ẏ, ln kxx, ln kyy, ln cxx, ln cyy] ,   θ̇ = 0 + w_θ   (random walk)
```

* **Log-parameterisation** guarantees positivity and makes a 30 % change the
  same "size" of step at any absolute value.
* **Primary estimator — joint UKF** (`ukf_twin.py`): propagates sigma points
  through the true nonlinear dynamics, no Jacobian needed.
* **EKF companion** (`ekf_twin.py`): analytic Jacobian whose parameter-
  sensitivity terms are the coupling core, e.g.

  ```
  ∂ẍ/∂(ln kxx) = −kxx·x/m ,   ∂ẍ/∂(ln cxx) = −cxx·ẋ/m
  ```

  Used to cross-validate the UKF and to expose the physics explicitly.
* **Adaptation rate** is set by the random-walk spectral densities `q_logk`,
  `q_logc` (config). They are scaled by `dt` so tuning is sample-rate
  independent.

**Observability caveat (important).** Damping is only weakly observable from
displacement measurements away from a critical speed. The included sweep
(`07_observability.png`) shows the damping-estimate error collapsing from ~110 %
at the service speed to ~5 % near the critical speed, while stiffness stays
accurate throughout. The baseline therefore **estimates stiffness (`kxx`,
`kyy`) and freezes damping at nominal** — the principled fallback. Any subset
can be estimated via the `estimate=` argument; nothing else changes.

## 4. Condition indicators (`indicators.py`)

* **NIS** (normalized innovation squared) — `~χ²(2)` when the model matches
  reality. A windowed NIS leaving the chi-square band is an early **anomaly**
  flag, independent of the parameter estimate.
* **Fault severity index** — once the filter tracks the degrading stiffness,
  its departure from nominal is reported as an interpretable **percentage loss**
  (`FSI_phys`) and as an uncertainty-normalized **Mahalanobis distance**
  (`FSI_stat`).
